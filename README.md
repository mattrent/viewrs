# viewrs

Simple SVG viewer with hide/show layer capability. Expects SVG layers to be defined with Inkscape. 


This software is very much untested. It was done in half a day because I needed to view an SVG file and hide/show layers, with no other feature required, and couldn't find something like that.


Usage:
```
./viewrs file.svg
```
